# Pathfinding Visualizer

[View the Live Demo](https://rjejoon.github.io/pathfinding-visualizer/)

A React-based web application that visualizes various pathfinding algorithms to help users understand their inner workings and behavior.


## Features

### Pathfinding Algorithms

- **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**: A simple level-order traversal algorithm.
- **DFS (Depth-First Search)**: Uses a stack-like mechanism to traverse deeper into the graph before backtracking.
- **Djikstraâ€™s Algorithm**: A weighted algorithm that finds the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes.
- **A\* Search**: Uses heuristics to prioritize paths that seem more promising.

### Maze Generation Algorithms

- **Recursive Division**: A recursive method that divides the maze space and adds walls.
- **Random Walls**: Randomly places walls throughout the grid.

### Pattern Generation

- **Simple Stair**: A pattern resembling stair steps.
- **Diagonal Line**: A straight line from one corner to the opposite.
- **Concentric Circles**: Multiple circles centered in the middle of the grid.
- **Vertical Stripes**: Parallel lines running vertically across the grid.
